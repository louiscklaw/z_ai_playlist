I\\'ve been given:\\n   - Dwayne Wade\\'s total rebounds in 2007-2008: 214 rebounds\\n   - Dwayne Wade\\'s total rebounds in 2008-2009: 398 rebounds\\n   - A number: 85.98130841121495\\n\\n3. This last number appears to be the percentage change calculation that the DataAnalystAgent computed. Let me verify this calculation:\\n\\nTo calculate the percentage change from 2007-2008 to 2008-2009:\\n- Formula: ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) × 100\\n- ((398 - 214) / 214) × 100 = (184 / 214) × 100 = 0.8598130841121495 × 100 = 85.98130841121495%\\n\\nSo the percentage change in Dwayne Wade\\'s total rebounds between the 2007-2008 and 2008-2009 seasons is approximately 85.98%.\\n\\nNow I can summarize the findings:\\n\\n1. Dwayne Wade was the Miami Heat player with the highest points in the 2006-2007 season (1397 points).\\n2. His total rebounds increased from 214 in the 2007-2008 season to 398 in the 2008-2009 season.\\n3. This represents a percentage increase of approximately 85.98%.\\n\\nI\\'ll now provide a complete summary and end with \"TERMINATE\".', type='ThoughtEvent'), TextMessage(id='b9a959ef-c18e-424e-b5bd-822e9af31875', source='PlanningAgent', models_usage=RequestUsage(prompt_tokens=669, completion_tokens=461), metadata={}, created_at=datetime.datetime(2025, 8, 7, 7, 34, 27, 779742, tzinfo=datetime.timezone.utc), content='Based on the information gathered:\\n\\n1.
